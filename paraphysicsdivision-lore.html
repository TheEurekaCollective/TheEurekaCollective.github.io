		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Paraphysics Division (PD) is a research organization dedicated to studying and utilizing <a class='infolink' href='paraphysics-lore'>paraphysical forces</a>. While mostly shrouded in mystery to the common person, the technologies and techniques that have been developed by the PD can be seen all over the Human Domain. From gravitic drives to <a class='infolink' href='spellrifles-lore'>spell rifles</a>, the work of the PD has helped humankind reach new technological heights.</p>
		<h2 id='history'>HISTORY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Paraphysics Division (PD) has its roots in several different nations from the Pre-Unification Era. Some of these include the USA’s Federal Bureau of Paraphysics, the USSR’s State Research Center of Koltsovo, and the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. After the Terran Accords, these institutes were merged into the Paraphysics Division of the Terran Union. The founders of this institution were Johannes Siddhar and Solana Igarashi due to them being the foremost scientists concerning paraphysics, with their research and papers serving as the foundation for thaumatology. More specifically, it was Siddhar’s “Esoteric Energies and Their Properties” and Igarashi’s “Theory of Conceptual Particle Interactions” that spurred the discovery and subsequent manipulation of psions, infons, and mana. In the late 21st century, the existence of paraphysical phenomena was revealed to the general public, with information dissemination campaigns heavily monitored by the PD.</p>
		<h2 id='organization'>ORGANIZATION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>When the PD was first founded, it was just a combination of independent organizations working in unison from what used to be different nations. However, this was later changed when the organizations were officially merged. Now, the PD is jointly led by a Chief Administrator, the Executive Council, and their respective AI. The organization is divided into sections which are further divided into departments. Sections are led by Section Directors while departments are led by Department Heads. Personnel of the division can also be split into various authorization tiers, with Alpha being the highest form of clearance.</p>
		<h2 id='composition'>COMPOSITION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='administration-sector'>Administration Sector</h3>
		<h4 id='chief-administrator'>Chief Administrator</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Chief Administrator is the leader of the Paraphysics Division and Administration Sector. One leader is chosen every decade, though there is no term limit. The CA has knowledge of all activities in the Paraphysics Division and is paired with Intendant Eureka, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
		<h4 id='executive-council'>Executive Council</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Executive Council is composed of the leaders of every sector and their partner AIs. They each possess one vote in the organization while the CA possesses two votes.</p>
		<h4 id='department-of-external-affairs-(dea)'>Department of External Affairs (DEA)</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The DEA Handles both foreign and Terran policy related to paraphysics.</p>
