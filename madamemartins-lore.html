		<h1 id='madame-martins'>MADAME MARTINS</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The invention of postnatal genetic modification and cellular sculpting bestowed upon humans the ability to modify their bodies as they see fit. This newfound ability was initially used for medical procedures but developed into a form of artistic expression by body artists. This denomination of fashion became known as fleshcraft. Madame Martins, a member of the 9 Muses Group, was established to cater to luxury fleshcraft clients. They accomplish everything from simple facial reworks to full body modification that would make a patient unrecognizable as a human.</p>
		<h2 id='organization'>ORGANIZATION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Like any corporation, Madame Martins possesses a Board of Directors, Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Treasurers, Secretaries, and the like. However, the two notable groups are the engineers and the biologists. While the engineers focus on mechanical modifications, the biologists are tasked with making genetic and cellular modifications.</p>
		<h2 id='operations'>OPERATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Madame Martins takes pride in their work to redefine what it means to be a human. There is no modification that they cannot accomplish, as their only limitation is their imagination. Engineers and biologists utilize special biotubes built by <a class='infolink' href='materna-lore'>Materna</a> or 6D printers from  Creidhne to construct the specimens their client demands. Bespoke robots then utilize a variety of technologies, including nanorobots and chemical therapy, to either graft specimens onto their clients or modify their clients directly. This process and set of modifications are referred to as a morph.</p>
		<h2 id='locations'>LOCATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Extreme body modifications, such as those of the gargantua type, are strictly prohibited from public spaces within most human cities due to them posing a public danger. To address this, Madame Martins constructed specialized habitation cylinders to act as both habitats and social spaces for their clients. These cylinders host a wide range of environments, from deserts to oceans. However, they all converge at a central cylinder where most of the clients inhabit. Here, iron-clad golems tromp on the streets while dragons fly between their aeries. Homo felisians can mingle with a child of Argus while mermaids swim in great glass aquariums. It is a true statement of accommodating architecture, as specialized infrastructure for nearly all major types of modifications are available.</p>
		<h2 id='notable-morphs'>NOTABLE MORPHS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='ancalagon-the-black'>Ancalagon the Black</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ancalagon the Black was a dragon from the ancient Silmarillion, a companion book to the Lord of the Rings saga. Within the lore, it could crush mountains and blacken the sky with its wings. Orpheus Irad of House Irad was inspired by this fictional figure, and chose it to be his morph. He constructed a specialized habitation cylinder that would serve as his aerie and constructed an entire division of sculptors to create the morph. Redundant hearts, graphene skin, and lighter-than-air gas sacs were just some of the myriad modifications made to Orpheus’s body. The morph took several months to complete due to the sheer volume of organic and mechanical matter that needed to be printed.</p>
		<h3 id='uriel,-the-light-of-god'>Uriel, the Light of God</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Uriel, the Light of God, was a seraphic morph commissioned by Safara Gotfir of House Gotfir. It is an angel clad entirely in red-orange flame standing at thirteen meters in height. Embedded in the morph’s chest was a greatsword of the same infernal nature. This was accomplished by implanting various glands along the body that produced a gas. This gas would be contained in a small field that, when ignited, produced a smokeless flame. A series of bodily reinforcements such as fullerene reinforced bone were also necessary to aid in helping Safara grow to and maintain the commissioned size.</p>
