		<h1 id='nexus'>NEXUS</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Nexus is a complex series of transportation systems residing within the <a class='infolink' href='cosmology-lore#void'>Void</a>. While it is unknown as to who constructed it, it is theorized to be from before the Theomachy. This system is special from the jump and Void highway systems in the sense that it can pass through mass shadows originating from the <a class='infolink' href='cosmology-lore#material-plane'>Material Plane</a>. It is essentially gravitically dead from both the inside and the “outside.”</p>
		<h2 id='denizens'>DENIZENS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The primary denizens of the Nexus are a group of intelligences known as pontifices (singular</p>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>pontifex). Pontifices each have their own section of the Nexus that they possess full control over. Each pontifex acts independently of each other, possessing their own wills and personalities. They can be hostile, friendly, or neutral, with said dispositions seemingly chosen at random. To traverse a specific section of the Nexus, a traveler has to be approved by the sector’s pontifex. Currently, thousands of these sectors and pontifices exist, with some beyond the edge of the galaxy.</p>
		<h3 id='pontifex-hostilities'>Pontifex Hostilities</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Pontifices possess a form of free will and so some of them exhibit hostilities towards one another, as their primary precept is that of expansion. This leads to battles between pontifices, with the victor overtaking the sector of the vanquished.</p>
		<h3 id='dead-pontifices'>Dead Pontifices</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A pontifex is very rarely killed by a non-pontifex. In those instances, their sector would either be left derelict or consumed by a neighboring pontifex.</p>
		<h3 id='defense'>Defense</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Intruders are dealt with by pontifices swiftly through methods such as closing itself off, collapsing tunnel sections, or even opening itself up to the Void. What might be a planet-sized tunnel one second may be a pinhole the next. However, these actions are highly energy intensive and most pontifices usually resort to using defense constructs known as sentinels. Akin to pontifices,  sentinels are also highly varied. Some are swarms of nanomachines while others are melee-oriented golems. Attempts to remove portions of the tunnels are also met with deadly force.</p>
		<h2 id='environment'>ENVIRONMENT</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Nexus, in its base form, is simply a series of small vacuum corridors. Travelers with the proper permissions can request that a tunnel be dilated or contracted, or that a specific section be terraformed. As a result, certain pontifices have allowed various ecosystems and constructs to flourish.</p>
		<h2 id='travel'>TRAVEL</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>To enter the Nexus, one must use a designated Nexus Gate. They are rings of variable size spread throughout the galaxy. There used to be many spread throughout the galaxy, but the Theomachy had destroyed many, leading to a massive reconstruction project after the war. However, since opening a Nexus Gate requires the permission of a friendly pontifex, various factions maintain control over their own gates. There exists at least one Nexus Gate within each major city of the <a class='infolink' href='galacticcommonwealth-lore'>Galactic Commonwealth</a>.</p>
		<h2 id='groups'>GROUPS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Many factions have arisen over time to take advantage of the Nexus and the pontifices.</p>
		<h3 id='fellowship-of-voidwalkers'>Fellowship of Voidwalkers</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Fellowship of Voidwalkers is a subset of <a class='infolink' href='karanaan-lore'>Karanaan</a> dedicated to exploring and mapping the multitude of pathways of the Nexus. They designate greenlit sectors and maintain some dead sectors. Due to the geography and politics of the Nexus constantly changing, the task of the Fellowship of Voidwalkers is considered to be very important. Within this faction also resides a cult, worshipping a prophesied figure they call “Damdayu, the Freewalker”. This entity would be universally regarded as friendly by all pontifices, allowing it to travel unabated throughout the Nexus.</p>
		<h3 id='ikujo'>Ikujo</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Ikujo are an expansive and powerful crime family that have forged a pact with a pontifex known as Zaramin. They specialize in all sorts of black market activity, but their main forte within the Nexus is the smuggling of goods considered illegal by the Galactic Commonwealth.</p>
		<h2 id='exploration'>EXPLORATION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Due to the risk posed by a potentially hostile pontifex, new sectors are explored via remote drones deployed by the Fellowship of Voidwalkers.</p>
		<h2 id='notable-locations'>NOTABLE LOCATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Various permanent locations have been established or found within the Nexus, including the Free City of Jakka and the Lost Civilization of Indalu.</p>
		<h2 id='incidents'>INCIDENTS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>On very rare occasions, a voidborne vessel will crash into one of the tunnels that compose the Nexus. If it is big and fast enough, it may destroy parts of the underlying structure.</p>
