		<h1 id='koios-institute'>KOIOS INSTITUTE</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Koios Institute is a collection of loosely related organizations within the Terran Union. They are responsible for the exploration and investigation of various phenomena within the universe, including astrogeology and biology.</p>
		<h2 id='organizations'>ORGANIZATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='horizon-league'>Horizon League</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Horizon League is dedicated to exploring the vast expanses of space. They maintain humanity’s celestial maps and establish new stations as they go. Their predecessor was the United Celestial Cartographers, but this changed after the Terran Accords due to the assimilation of other organizations. They have been the source of many exploration efforts such as the creation of generation ships and faster-than-light research.</p>
		<h3 id='human-heritage-preservation-society'>Human Heritage Preservation Society</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Human Heritage Preservation Society is charged with collecting and preserving human artifacts from throughout human history.</p>
		<h4 id='human-heritage-reserve'>Human Heritage Reserve</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Acropolis of Athens no longer serves as the base of the Parthenon, Cairo no longer rests under the shadow of the Pyramids, and the Terracotta Army no longer stands in Qin Shi Huangdi's mausoleum. Those, and other cultural artifacts of the human species, have been transported to the Human Heritage Reserve of the Human Heritage Preservation Society. The reserve, also known as Artifact City, is composed of several interconnected cylinders of varying sizes. Each reserve has an artificial sun and a unique biosphere. Entire cities have been transported to this reserve in order to protect them from degradation and natural disasters. This facility is public and free to access, encouraging millions to visit the facility every day. These reserves are also equipped with superluminal drives, so that the artifacts may escape in the event of an emergency.</p>
		<h3 id='foundation-of-biology'>Foundation of Biology</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Foundation of Biology investigates all forms of life, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial. They have brought back extinct species, translated animal languages, and researched the alien life of the <a class='infolink' href='milkywaygalaxy-lore'>Milky Way</a>.</p>
		<h4 id='habitats'>Habitats</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Habitats are a series of arcologies created as habitats for extinct species that have been revived through genetic manipulation processes. These arcologies consist of vast artificial environments that best suit their dependent species. Some of the species that have been brought back and inhabit these environments include the Irish elk, wooly mammoth, and dire wolf. Some of the aforementioned species have also been allowed back into their original habitats on Terra, such as the woolly mammoths that currently live in the Arctic tundra.</p>
		<h4 id='animal-translators'>Animal Translators</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>While the uplifting of non-sophont species is still considered highly controversial, animal translators are in fact very popular. These translators are essentially brain-computer interfaces that utilize AI to learn and understand the thoughts of animals. In fact, one of the most famous celebrities within the Human Domain is Octavius, a veined octopus.</p>
		<h3 id='terran-environmental-assembly'>Terran Environmental Assembly</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Terran Environmental Assembly (TEA) monitors and protects the various ecologies present on Terra. This branch was established during the Terran Environmental Restoration Projects, a series of initiatives that utilized natural, technological, and social means to improve the state of the environment on Terra. Some of the initiatives include the restoration of the polar ice caps, the construction of carbon sequestration plants in cities, and the subsidization of underground vertical farms. These and many more projects have helped humankind live in harmony with nature. Now, solar farms cover the various deserts of the world, cities of white are clad in flora and fauna, and the dodos once again tread the island of Mauritius.</p>
