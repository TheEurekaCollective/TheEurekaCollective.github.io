		<h1 id='slime-mold'>SLIME MOLD</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Slime mold is an umbrella term used to describe various single-celled protists that can coalesce to form complex structures. While originally used in tasks such as neural network simulations and civil engineering, they are now commonly seen as pets within the Human Domain due to their low maintenance and peculiar, seemingly alien, behaviors.</p>
		<h2 id='species'>SPECIES</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>There are many species of slime molds that are kept as pets. Some of these include physarum polycephalum (blob), fuligo septica (dog’s vomit), and hemitrichia serpula (pretzel slime). They are usually chosen by owners due to their shape and color, as the behaviors of slime molds do not vary much from species to species. Genetic splicing and modification have also allowed some very interesting species to come to life, such as the eclipse slime mold, possessing a pure black color that exhibits a form of bioluminescence.</p>
		<h2 id='maintenance'>MAINTENANCE</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Keeping and maintaining a slime mold varies from species to species, but the process is usually quite simple. Slime molds do not require much in terms of interaction and need only to be fed. Slime molds kept in more natural terrariums are regularly supplied with fresh detritus and decaying organic matter. However, those kept in less natural environments are provided alternatives such as oat flakes and valerian root.</p>
		<h2 id='equipment'>EQUIPMENT</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Mobile terrariums are robotic bodies that utilize various sensors and tactile stimuli to allow a slime mold to somewhat rudimentarily pilot walking vessels. The slime mold also acts as the robot’s central processing unit -- stored in a glass terrarium for viewing pleasure. The glass has multiple settings to allow in variable amounts of light, as slime molds generally have an aversion to it. The interiors of the terrarium are also highly modular, with not only the environmental conditionals able to be changed but also the physical layout. Clever slime mold owners have been known to make living sculptures and tapestries by growing slime molds in different patterns and setups. Many owners also grow different species in the same setting, adding another layer of complexity to making slime mold art.</p>
		<h2 id='acquisition'>ACQUISITION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>While it is possible to buy a newly grown slime mold, most people tend to prefer splitting one of their family’s existing colonies. It is not uncommon to see colonies of slime molds hundreds of years old, passed down from generation to generation. People often keep multiple colonies of slime molds as a collection.</p>
