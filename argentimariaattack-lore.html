		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Argentimaria Attack was a BCI-based psychotechnical terrorist attack that took place in the lunar city of Argentimaria. On the seventh of November, 2133, a fanatical anti-BCI group known as Ad Antea penetrated the servers of Neurogenesis, a popular BCI firm at the time, and instigated a neurovirus attack through a backdoor. While many people who owned BCIs had guardian AI to help sift through data traffic and remove potentially malignant information, a specifically tailored trojan virus was generated by Ad Antea for this operation. The deployment of this virus allowed Ad Antea a strong degree of control over people’s nervous system, more importantly their motor control.</p>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The ensuing chaos was seen through live capture footage, showing people tearing themselves apart while fully conscious, children jumping off the roofs of buildings, and others simply standing perfectly still staring at the sun. Even the animals were not spared, with security footage showing owners getting eaten alive by their own beloved pets. A rogue craft crashed into the side of the atmospheric dome, causing a large rupture that sucked out more than a hundred people before being sealed by expanding foam. It took Neurogenesis an entire sixteen minutes to realize the issue and stop the data streams, but in that short time frame the damage was already done. More than five thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more were injured.</p>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>After the attack, analyst AI of the Terran Union quickly determined that Ad Antea was behind the attack. Foxhound, an anti-terrorism division of the Terran military. was tasked to find Ad Antea and bring in the perpetrators for trial and imprisonment. Several days of investigation found that the signal used to begin the attack originated from Eris in the Sol System. Foxhound thaumaturgists were deployed and held the orbital facilities of Eris under lockdown. The perpetrators were caught and were each sentenced to twelve centuries in a chronoprison.</p>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The aftereffects of the Argentimaria Attack were widespread. Neurogenesis was held accountable for failing to prevent the tragedy, with the company being disbanded a few weeks later. Newer, stricter regulations were drawn up by the Union government concerning the administration and application of brain-computer interfaces. Many people within the Human Domain lost faith in BCIs for a while, causing a recession in the BCI sector of the market. After the city of Argentimaria was repaired and the bodies buried, a memorial was established where on the seventh of every November, leaders of the Terran Union would visit to honor those that had suffered.</p>
