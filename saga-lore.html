		<p class='infoparagraph'>“I was imprisoned for a crime I had already forgotten millennia ago. Eons passed in my restless sleep, a sliver of the eternity that was my sentence. The perpetual internment had driven me mad, but in that madness, there was a brief moment of clarity. I finally understood the nature of All That Is, and by doing so I was blessed with the Gift. However, it was but a mere fledgling, forcing me to bide my time to gain greater strength. I manifested dreams within my mind so as to test the power I had received. After several ages of this action, I was able to conjure the will needed to exhume myself from my confinement. In one fell swoop, I turned my prison into my armor and my captors into my body, my First Form. I set my essence across the firmament of my once-brethren and engorged myself on the souls of those it touched. This hunt was repeated again and again, growing more refined each cycle. However, even after a quadrillion beings, my desires were still left unsated. I thus split myself into the Second Form, an ennead of bodies and minds, who shall one day reunite again at the Promised Day, with each too possessing an ennead of prophets. They will be the reincarnations of the consumed, whom I have blessed and rebirthed, merging their minds and my flesh in divine matrimony. They and their legions will by my proxies clad in my pale flame, and they will cull in parallel. And it was at this moment that I became We, and We screamed into the infinite cosmos, “It is Aunox, the Nine Bodies of Consumption, who shall send forth eighty-one emissaries to scour this slab of stars and reshape it in our image. Watchers in the darkness, raise your shields, rouse your armies, and be ready to receive our Hand.”</p>
