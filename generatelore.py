article = """===PARAPHYSICS
Paraphysics is an umbrella term used to refer to conceptual-material (metaphysical-physical) interactions. It can be divided into three fields: thaumaturgy, theurgy, and onturgy. Each one of these fields utilizes paraphysics in different ways to different effects.
=Entities
To understand paraphysics, one must first understand the composition of an entity. Entities are the product of a soma, anchor, and soul coming together. In short, it is an independent organism. A living thing cannot exist without the existence of all these three. The soma is the physical body that serves as the foundation for the anchor. The anchor is the product of specific patterns of energy. When an anchor is generated, it pushes an information signature into the Conceptual Plane. This signature is known as the soul. The soul has no will of its own—it’s simply a container for memories.
==THAUMATOLOGY
Thaumatology is the science of using mana and conceptual particles to influence particle interactions and the art of thaumaturgy is its application. Thaumaturgy is the most widely understood and developed form of paraphysics due to every living thing possessing the potential to learn it and apply it.
=Process
When a thaumaturgist targets an infon or a set of infons, a “system” is designated. Psions and mana are coalesced in a spell and are directed towards the target system. For an infon to successfully be bonded and overwritten by a psion, the necessary energy threshold must be reached. This is the phase where mana is injected into the system, allowing for the psion to bind to the infon and rewrite it. The particles within the system then carry out the command of the newly rewritten infon. This process is limited by the speed of light.
={Spells}
Spells are information packages that are composed using a ritual, which calculates the necessary commands for the target system.
=Reagents
_Mana
Mana is an energy constantly produced by the interactions between the Conceptual and Material Planes. This is most common in the form of souls, which are intrusions into the Conceptual Plane. The larger a system is, the more mana it requires for fuel. If the psion cluster contains a command that its mana partner does not have enough energy for, the bonding will not work at all. Mana is produced through a method called “intrusion”. When a being is born, its soul forces its way into the Conceptual Plane. This location is completely randomized. The closer a soul’s conceptual location is to the Font, the more mana they initially produce. The limit for mana production is theoretically infinite, but its rarity increases exponentially when a soul is to the Font. Mana production can also be influenced by age. The older a soul is, the greater its signature grows. This allows for an increased intrusion, and thus an increased rate of mana production.
_Psions
Psions are a byproduct of anchor generation. These particles carry the commands and calculations of the spellcaster. The number of necessary psions needed to stimulate a reaction scales proportionally with the complexity of a system. As a result, the more complex a system is, the more processing power is required.
_Infons
Everything in the material universe is part of something known as the Infonic Web. This Web is composed of fragments of order known as information particles (infons). It contains the information for how everything within its system is meant to interact and operate. From the smallest subatomic particle to the largest of galaxies, each one has an infon—becoming more advanced the more complicated its system is.
=Principles and Notes
_Uncertainty Principle
Due to the abundance of infons in the universe, it is difficult to target a single specific infon. As a result, spells are reduced to approximations and are graded on accuracy rather than precision.
_Variation Principle
No two spellcasters’ spells are the same. This is due to the inherent differences in how entities perceive and process information. Certain memories can be linked to a particular spell and subconsciously influence it in some way. Spells must be regularly updated to account for changing mental states as well.
_Imperfect Efficiency
Thaumaturgy is not perfectly efficient—controlled systems would still be exposed to uncontrolled systems. As a result, a “system” is usually a sphere with lessening effects the further from it is from the center.
_Multi-Targeting
When multiple entities target the same system, infons rewrite themselves based on the most recent psion. However, in multiple-psion systems, due to the Split System Principle, the effects of the psions are coalesced, turning the systems into averages of the psion streams.
_Mana Limit
People can only generate a certain amount of mana at a time. Once stored mana is exhausted, and mana is being consumed faster than it can be replenished, the spells are canceled.
_Learning Curve
Thaumaturgy is a learned skill. One needs to understand how to generate a phenomenon in order to properly rewrite the target Infon. However, basic spells can be accessed with the infoweb.
_Implications
While there was much confusion concerning thaumaturgy when it was first discovered, it is now ambiguous and fundamental in modern life. However, even the most advanced scientists in the Human Domain have still not figured out what allows neural activity to produce psions, the origin of mana, and the existence the Conceptual Plane as a whole.
_Psion Limit
Naturally, anchors can only emit so many Psions at a given time. With the help of Psionic Extension, psions could be used more efficiently and even increased.
_Accuracy
Psions and mana are line-of-sight particles. This means that psions have a very small chance of intercepting a non-target Infon. On top of this, humans that aim psions unassisted are most likely going to miss. As a result, wands are used to help linearize fired psions.
_Archaic
Various practices used by ancient thaumaturgists have been tested and debunked through scientific analysis. One of these were Divine Words. Divine Words—otherwise known as Verses—are in actuality just a means of organizing the caster’s thoughts. The words themselves have no magical effect; they are simply a method for pacing rituals, where large numbers of casters compose a singular spell. Verses are no longer in use due to their inefficiency.
==THEURGY (SHAMANISM)
Theurgy is the study of anima and their effects on the material universe. Theurgists subjugate anima and use them for their own benefit.
=Channeling
Channeling is necessary for an anima to induce phenomena within the Material Plane. To accomplish channeling, an anima must manifest itself using an existing anchor. Manifestation is the process where an anima uses the soul of one of its constituents known as a Host as an entry point into the Material Plane. The anima and soul share the soma and anchor, forming a connection and allowing the anima’s abilities to be exhibited in the Material Plane. The more of an adherent the soul is to the anima, the more effective this connection is. However, the sharing of the anchor places strain on it. This induces Anchor Decay, which wears down and eventually destroys the anchor, thereby killing the Host. This can be decreased if the entity dedicates more of its soul towards the anima. Anchor Decay can also be prevented by strengthening the anchor. Ideally, the perfect anima-soul connection induces negligible amounts of anchor decay, and the Host is able to take full advantage of the anima’s set of abilities.
=Forms
An anima can serve as a “conceptual processor.” Any forms of expression, dubbed “vectors,”  can be used as a catalyst that allows the anima to generate phenomena through a Host. This means specific sounds, patterns, and symbols that are correlated with an anima can be used to produce phenomena. Such vectors include scribery, choristry, illustration, and composition.
=Principles and Notes
_Spontaneity
Channeling an anima is a heavily prepared process. One must dedicate oneself to one’s anima to have the anima let one use its powers. Some might spend their entire lives worshipping or devoting themselves to an anima, yet are never able to channel its powers.
==ONTURGY (ONEIROMANCY, REALITY BENDING)
Onturgy is, by far, the most esoteric out of the three fields of paraphysics. This is due to its nature as a boon from the god of Existence, the Dreamer. In essence, the art of onturgy is rewriting reality. It is unknown how many possess this ability within the Milky Way Galaxy, but the current estimation rests at nine.
=Theory
While not much is known about onturgy, some theories have been produced to explain this phenomenon. The current prevailing theory amongst academic circles that study the phenomenon (which are rare themselves) is that reality exists upon a baseline. Every living thing experiences the baseline reality relatively unchanged. However, onturgists possess the power to generate their own sub-realities and impose them on baseline reality. However, it has been noted that onturgists can only bend reality, not change it entirely. This means they obey causality to some extent and they cannot do things like erase someone's past, as that would imply time travel.
=Acquisition
A being can, very rarely, achieve a state of self-imposed apotheosis. They can do this by understanding the true nature of the Dream. When they do so, they are paid a visit by the Dreamer, and are given the ability to warp reality.
=Principles and Notes
_Scarcity
Reality benders are often alone and have to learn by themselves due to the rarity of the skill. Due to their solitude, they have also developed highly varied personalities, goals, and onturgical techniques."""
