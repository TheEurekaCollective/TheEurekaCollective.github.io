article = """===PARAPHYSICS DIVISION
Scribes Consortium is a galaxy-spanning megaconglomerate composed of the majority of {anima}-based organizations within the {Galactic Commonwealth}. From host-based data encryption to paraphysical substance production, the Consortium has a footing in almost every industry. In short, they manufacture, subjugate, and sell gods for a profit.
==COMMAND
=Triumvirate
Before the first humans discovered agriculture, the founding Triumvirate established the Scribes Consortium. They are known as Archimedean Zodrak, Beldam Hetach, and Rhapsodist Klioxes. Masters and visionaries of their respective fields, the Triumvirate were and still are the primary ruling body of TSC.
=Council
The Council is composed of the president of each company that is part of TSC. They are a ruling body that coexists alongside the Triumvirate.
==SUBSIDIARIES
=Ilgurzi
Roughly translating to “Scribes”, the Ilgurzi were originally a cabal of enchanter-calligraphers hailing from the planet Dakhara. Their nimble manipulators and large memories allowed them to store the glyphs and symbols of thousands of languages. As a result, they were highly sought after by both kings and prophets to record their speeches and sermons. It was considered a great honor to have one's words written in the Ilgurzi Script known as Puchep, the “Immortal Alphabet”. Although the original inscription would wear away with time, the holographic projection of the letter would not. This reliability also led for a currency system to be based on Puchep. While no longer used for minting currency, the tradition of immortalizing the words of great leaders continues to this day. The Ilgurzi are charged with producing scribery-based products such as starlit spheres and runic circuit boards. While already possessing a multitude of languages, more complex ones are being created every day by the Ilgurzi.
_Starlit Spheres
Starlit Spheres are a form of photonic computer that generates glyphs on command and uses the Archimedean language as a form of computer language. They are essentially omni tools, provided they are supplied with sufficient mana.
_Runic Circuit Board
This is a largely retired product as RCBs are considered archaic within the Galactic Commonwealth. An RCB is laid out in the pattern of specific symbols and runes, creating a layer of redundancy in terms of operational effectiveness.
=Onten
The {Sharhastian} peoples were born on a world with a dim sun and crushing gravity. As a result, their ears and vocal chords became their main forms of communication and interaction. They are born with perfect pitch and possess the capacity to replicate any sound. Onten was founded as a modernization of the fable-songs used to pass down knowledge from generation to generation. In the 26th century, they not only sell a variety of magical instruments and listening devices, but also have their own music production divisions and groups. One of the most popular of these groups is a chorister hive headed by Queen Aria.
=Skada Chaheyo
In the ancient times of Sharhast, Skada Chaheyo was the ancient art of choristry adapted for war. Complex chants and melodies allowed choristers to shake the earth, summon plagues, or bless bodies with strength. The organization founded under the same name was often hired by militaries to act as combat minstrels. In the modern day, they work in the defense sector as information warfare specialists and weapons manufacturing (e.g.: sonic weaponry).
=Yillvisk
The use of particle control can aid in the creation or preservation of materials that would not be considered naturally occurring. These include slowing the decay of superheavy elements on higher islands of stability and the creation of exotic compounds and alloys. Currently, Yillvisk has been experimenting with a form of primitive computronium. They also produce a variety of foods, media, and hyperelements. Some of these materials are “active” materials, meaning they have an anima maintaining and watching over them.
=Duzo Ko ‘eke
Duzo Ko ‘eke is a design firm specialized in memetic design and implantation. They incorporate memetics subliminally in all of TSC’s products. Members of Duzo Ko ‘eke are often contracted by other companies to design their products. They also are responsible for product placement and advertising schemes. A subdivision of Duzo Ko ‘eke specializes in implanting internal holograms, drawing tattoos, and enacting scarification for clients.
=Tyrami
Tyrami is responsible for researching neural technologies to improve hosting capabilities. They also are responsible for storing the bodies of dead hosts in specialized containment units.
=Hakita
Hakita is responsible for anima and data hosting within TSC. They monitor and maintain the servers and memory storage apparatuses as well as carry out turnovers when necessary.
=Pelatanuh
Pelatanuh is a private security and military contracting company meant to deal with anima-based threats. They do this by deploying empowered hosts developed for any sort of combat situation. Anima and hosts could be edited live based on the changing battlefield.
=Kero
Actions that take place within the Conceptual Plane are instantaneous. As a result, it is possible for hosts to communicate with one another with an anima as a medium. While this used to be done with tap plates and inscription stones, the process has been updated. Specially modified hosts known as ansibles are interned in the Galactic Commonwealth’s internet to achieve instantaneous communication for even the furthest points in the galaxy. To maintain high degrees of security with ansibles, a new anima is generated every time an ansible is created. These devices are produced and maintained by Kero.
==HOSTING
The majority of the Scribes Consortium’s activities would not be feasible without mass hosting. This takes advantage of the information/memetic nature of anima and controls it. If an anima with specific properties is needed, it is manufactured using the Aksil Process. Named after Qursias Aksil, this is the process of injecting memories into individuals so that they are able to host the anima. These manufactured memories are known as simulacrums. In short, the Aksil Process allows for production and manipulation of anima. The locations where this process takes place are known as Dream Halls.
=Host Types:
_Passive
Passive hosts are the most numerous type of anima host within the Scribes Consortium. These are usually just citizens and employees that enter simulations. Such simulations are indistinguishable from real life and vary from playing videogames to living through torture. The memories made are known as simulacrums. Especially painful memories are known as “Namo Class” and participants can choose to have mental locks placed on such memories. They will essentially become unable to consciously recall the memory unless it is unlocked. Passive Hosts are supplemented by Cognition Stacks. These are servers composed of neural material that serve the same purpose as Passive Hosts.
_Designated Hosts
Designated Hosts (DHs) are genetically and mechanically modified organisms used to serve as bodies for certain anima. These are husks until implanted with an anima. They essentially inject experiences into the nervous system of the DH and since the husk has little to no free will on its own, the anima more or less has complete control over the individual. These hosts can take a variety of shapes but their starting form has little value as an anima will adapt its form to suit its Domain regardless (given sufficient materials). DHs are grown in BioTubes then placed into a Matter Injection Apparatus. When the anima is integrated, specific elements are injected into the host. There are various uses for hosts. Some are soldiers, some produce paraphysical materials, and others are used as communication devices. There are also rare instances when an anima or a host will go rogue. While a rogue anima is problematic, a rogue host is even more so, as its actions have consequences within the Material Plane. However, they are quite rare and are usually the result of a system malfunction."""
