article = """===UNIVERSAL CARTRIDGE
The universal cartridge is a kinetic composition and delivery system devised and constructed through a collaboration between Creidhe, Transmute, and Weybaan Dynamics. It is essentially a cartridge printing technology, making it one of the most widely used weapons systems within the Human Domain.
==ORGANIZATION
=Creidhe
Creidhe’s contribution to this system was the printing apparatus and its material cartridges. They utilize 6D printers that can accept a variety of materials and have functions such as magnetic stabilization and flash vacuum molding. Cartridge printers utilize a staged printing process where different components of the cartridge are compiled along a linear pathway.
=Weybaan Dynamics
Weybaan Dynamics provided the ballistics technology and proprietary components such as microcomputers and guidance packages.
=Transmute
Transmute is a materials acquisition and production company that provides the raw materials needed in the material cartridges used by Creidhe.
==UNIVERSAL CARTRIDGE
While universal cartridges vary in composition, there are some similarities found throughout most.
=Electronic Firing
The use of an electronic firing system aids in preventing cookoff, decreasing locktime, and increasing ergonomics.
=Polymer Propellant
The cartridge utilizes a printable polymer propellant that is triggered by a strong electric charge.
=Sprayable Transistor
An evaporable transistor pad is used to help ease the transfer of electricity from the firing face to the propellant.
=Caseless
Improvements in propellant technology has allowed for the forgoing of cased ammunition, decreasing the size of the cartridge and increasing the amount of energy dedicated to the projectile.
==PRINTING METHOD
Printing the cartridge is divided into several steps.
=Printer
The printer is most commonly a cylinder with recesses meant to accept printing cartridges. It has its own internal computer and is open on one end to allow for feeding cartridges into the firing chamber.
=Planning
Here, previous ballistics data and user commands are sent to the printer based on the situation at hand. This primes the printer for production. Here, the shape, strength, and composition of the cartridge and its constituent parts can be modified.
=Projectile Composition
At this stage, the projectile and its subsystems are printed.
=Propellant Composition
At this stage, the propellant is applied to the projectile in a manner that allows the projectile to be enveloped in the propellant, a process known as telescoping. The size and amount can also be adjusted for varying degrees of power.
=Primer Application
At the end of the printing process, a transistor is sprayed onto the rear of the cartridge, completing the production process.
==VARIATIONS
Modulation of a printer’s settings can produce different compositions of a cartridge.
=Shapes
_Conventional
The most widely used shape of ammunition are monolithic rounds such as those of the flat, boattail, and wadcutter shapes.
_Shaped Charge
A shaped charge contains an internal explosive that converts the projectile into a stream of molten metal upon penetration, allowing for an increase in damage.
_Shot
Balls of varying size can be printed to turn the weapon into a shotgun.
_Sabot
Finned needles, while smaller and possess less mass, travel at higher velocities and provide better armor penetration compared to their conventional counterparts.
_Hollow Point
Upon impact, a hollow point projectile will deform into a “mushroom”, allowing for a larger wound channel as well as preventing overpenetration on targets.
_Sectioned Fragmentors
Sectioned fragmentors are similar to hollow points but the head is divided into multiple sections, allowing for fragmentation upon impact and the creation of multiple wound channels.
=Materials
_Depleted Uranium
Improvements in radiation sealing, medical, respiratory, and transmutation technologies have made depleted uranium a viable small arms projectile. The depleted uranium is mixed with titanium to create a uranium-titanium alloy. The projectile is then coated with special nanolaminates that contain the radiation. At high enough speeds an exposed uranium projectile will exhibit pyrophytic effects within the atmosphere.
_Tungsten
Tungsten is denser than depleted uranium and as a result is sometimes used as a projectile. However, tungsten has lower penetrative power than depleted uranium as well as lacks the pyrophytic effect.
_Nanolaminate
Nanolaminate projectiles are the product of many single-atom layers of various materials being stacked on top of and bonded to each other.
_Ceramics
Ceramic projectiles are highly heat resistant and are used as a form of frangible projectile. They are commonly used in boarding actions to prevent creating breaches in the hull of a ship.
_Nanites
Nanite projectiles are tightly bound nanite swarms meant to infiltrate the bodies of their targets, allowing for various programs such as hacking to take place.
=Formats
_Mini-Missiles
Mini-missiles utilize a two-stage propelling system to balance recoil and speed. These are mostly handheld, large-caliber weaponry.
=Utility Packages
_Stabilization Fins
Stabilization fins controlled by computers are used to help guide the projectile while in flight. They could also act as brakes to help the projectile tumble upon penetration or hooks to make removal of the projectile harder.
_Explosives
Projectiles could be outfitted with explosives that are mass-reactive. Once embedded in the target they explode to cause additional damage. These charges could also be shaped to help penetrate armor.
_Micro-Computers
Micro-Computers can be placed in the cores of projectiles to feed tactical information to AI once they embedded themselves in their target, including technological and biological information.
==FIRING METHOD
When an operator pulls a weapon’s trigger either physically or mentally, a signal is sent from the trigger group to the firing face, upon which an electric charge is dispensed onto the transistor of the cartridge.
==APPLICATION
While universal cartridges can be modified and used for almost every type of firearm, only weapons of rifles and greater size contain an internal printer.
==NOTES
Universal Cartridge systems have also been used in electromagnetic accelerator weaponry, such as railguns and gauss guns. However, the printers used by these weapons forgo the primer and propellant stages of printing, and instead focus on creating payloads."""
