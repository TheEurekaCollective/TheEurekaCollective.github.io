article = """===UNYIELDING ARISTEA
The Unyielding Aristea is an Ascalon-class battlecruiser that serves as the flagship of the Terran Navy. It represents the finest of human engineering and skill. It is designed to operate for long periods of time both independently and within a fleet. It serves as both a scientific and military vessel.
==HISTORY
Due to the Aristea being one of the newest military vessels within the Terran Navy, it is a relatively undecorated history compared to its forebears. However, it served as a security attachment for the First Terran Delegation sent to the Infinite City, and by extension, the Galactic Commonwealth.
==SPECIFICATIONS
=Dimensions
At its largest points, the Aristea is approximately forty kilometers long, 3 kilometers tall, and 3 kilometers wide. Its shape is akin to a long pillar.
=Crew
_{Mage} Crew
The Unyielding Aristea hosts a {combat mage} complement of approximately a thousand. This is the largest complement of combat mages ever devoted to a single construct.
_Non-Mage Crew
The non-mage crew is composed of four thousand Terran Navy personnel. This personnel is tasked with piloting and maintaining the ship via neural uplink.
=Construction
The ship is primarily composed of enchanted nanolaminate plating. This material composes both the superstructure and armor.
_Armor
The hull of the Aristea is three layers of nanolaminate hull plating, each several meters thick. Between these layers is a liquid medium that turns into solid ceramic foam in the event of a breach to prevent the precious atmosphere from leaking out.
_Superstructure
The Aristea was built around a central supporting column that fractalized outwards in a curved hexagonal fashion. This provided a strong superstructure to the ship, allowed it to be modified and upgraded incrementally, and reduced potential stress points. Certain sections of the column are hollow so as to allow somatic threads to be integrated.
_Somatic Threads
Somatic threads run through the hollow pockets of the superstructure to provide power, data, mana, and psions to the entirety of the ship.
==EQUIPMENT
={Spell} Cannons
Spell cannons are the primary armament of most Terran ships. Everything from point defense systems to capital ship-grade weaponry utilizes spell cannons. This is due to the vacuum nature of space. Spells lack the necessary particles to affect. This means that particles need to be delivered to the target location first before spells are able to be used. Spell cannons come in several varieties, but the primary ones currently in usage are particle beams.
_Particle Beams
Particle beams fire exclusively photons, meaning that the particle is delivered at the same maximum speed spells are. This reduces latency. The most common spell used for particle beams is Claíomh Solais, where at the moment before impact, the photons are slowed and forced to form a crystalline structure, turning the beam into hardlight. This achieves a balance between the impact force afforded to kinetic projectiles as well as the heating effect exclusive to plasma weaponry. This is a major improvement on the more archaic mass accelerators as it increases the speed of the projectile significantly as well as reduces recoil to negligible amounts. This means that less reinforcement is required to prevent the ship from tearing itself apart as compared to the older mass accelerators.
=Missiles
When more nimble offensive measures are needed, long-range {antimatter} warheads are considered the staple. Magnetic coil launch tubes launch the missile at incredible speeds, where upon exiting its host vessel the missile’s directional thrusters will take over. These warheads are fired out of hundreds of retractable pods.
=Suspended Particle Grid
Particles that would normally be vented from the ship are instead projected outwards using a particle suspension grid. This serves as a form of energy shielding for the ship.
=Point Defense System
The spell cannon-based PDS protects the Aristea from incoming missiles and small attack vehicles.
=SF-12 Talaria Drive
The SF-12 Talaria Drive is a form of {warp} drive that utilizes advanced gravitic fields to generate imperfections in space time. Space in front of the ship is compressed while space behind the ship is extended, allowing for a field in space that is essentially moving forward. This allows the ship to move at both subluminal and superluminal speeds. When necessary, the ship can also change the shape of the fields to act as a form of shielding. However, this is not the primary form of movement as it is incredibly energy intensive.
=N23 Omnidirectional Gravitic Engine
The N23-OGE emits gravity wells in space. These wells are generated at precise locations so as to allow the ship to be pulled toward them. This is the primary form of sublight movement. Due to the nature of the N23-OGE, the Aristea can move omnidirectionally, a feature that was not as feasible by prior mass-ejection engines.
=K-Series Inertial Compensator
To prevent the crew and contents from being damaged when moving at high sublight speeds, the Aristea is equipped with an Inertial Compensation Field.
=Control
Control modules control all of the systems required to operate the Aristea. These modules are placed near the center of the ship to afford the best protection.
_Command Module
The command module is where the human pilots of the Aristea link directly into the ship. They meld into a version of a collective consciousness that allows them to have incredibly refined direct control over the ship as well as give commands to the mages and artificial intelligences easily.
_Mage Pilot Module
Mage pilots, copilots, and their ghost are tasked with all ship and ship combat-related operations. This means moving the ship around, compiling sensory data, and calculating warp jump solutions.
_Mage Intendant Module
The intendant module of the Aristea is charged with maintaining the habitation systems necessary for the non-mage crew. It also handles other utility functions such as factory operations and antimatter plant usage.
=Utility
_Gravitic Plating
Gravitic plating helps orient the members of the crew orient themselves in a single “down” direction. While in most instances the gravity is set to 1 G, this can be increased significantly as a retention measure in the event of a hull breach.
_Habitation Units
The non-mage crew of the ship has their own space for rest and relaxation. This includes the mess hall, personal habitats, and arcology. Within the mess hall, robotic chefs, food printers, and self-cooking stations allow the crew to enjoy any food or drink they wish. The personal habitats are a collection of modular rooms that could be reconfigured to suit its inhabitants’ needs. Finally, there exists an arcology that is composed of various flora and fauna. This section is maintained by drones and sealed off when not in use to prevent the escape of animals and insects.
_Maintenance Systems
Almost all of the internal maintenance systems of the Aristea are drone-operated. This allows for maintenance and service corridors to be much smaller and save space.
_Factory
Advanced printing systems allow for nearly anything to be produced on the ship, given the necessary materials. This allows for the ship and its inhabitants to operate for long periods without resupply.
_Cooling Rods
Cooling Rods oriented towards the rear of the ship allow for waste heat to be removed efficiently.
_Micro-Wormhole Generator
The MWG allows the UA to communicate instantaneously with central command. It operates by opening up a wormhole then sending an optical communications laser.
_Mana-Catalysed Antimatter Reactor
The MCAR powers all of the UA’s functions. In the event that the primary reactor fails, an auxiliary fusion reactor is activated. However, this only allows the ship to operate on low power.
_Antimatter Plant
Due to the focus of the flagship being that of operational independence, an onboard antimatter plant allows for portable fuel production.
_Frigate Complement
Gungnir-Class assault frigates can rapidly deploy from the UA to act as scouts as well as offer additional firepower.
_Dropships
Dropships allow the repeated deployment of everything from personnel to heavy vehicles.
_Central Transport
The size of the ship necessitated a method to transport personnel and goods. A tram network runs throughout the ship for this purpose.
_Cognition Stacks
Cognition stacks serve as the central processing units for the mages and their ghosts. This is essentially enhanced neural material that is psionically entangled with their respective mages.
_Computer Servers
To calculate the various physical solutions needed to allow spells to function, quantum computers are utilized. These computers also house the true bodies of the various artificial intelligences and ghosts.
_Sensors
The UA possesses no windows. Instead, it uses an advanced sensor suite including long-range cameras and sensors to observe its surroundings. It also utilizes advanced scanner technology to detect enemy ships and foreign bodies.
_Multi-Use Launch Tubes
MULTs are used to deliver breaching pods, drop pods, and escape pods. Breaching pods are used for boarding actions on lightly armored ships. Drop pods are used for atmospheric entry and are usually used to deliver mages, drones, and equipment. Finally, there are escape pods. Escape pods usually contain life-support systems, beacons, and communications arrays. Under Terran law, escape pods must be marked as escape pods and are not allowed to be shot down. During military engagements, soldiers in escape pods are taken as POWs.
_Laboratories
The various laboratories built into the UA study the various alien specimens and technologies found throughout the UA’s travels, as well as improve and research existing technologies."""
