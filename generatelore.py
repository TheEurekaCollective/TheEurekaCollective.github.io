article = """===GALACTIC COMMONWEALTH
The Galactic Commonwealth, otherwise known as the Commonwealth, is a collection of loosely associated nations and species. It is the dominant organization within the {Milky Way}, composed of hundreds of member states and being on friendly terms with the majority of living {onturgists}.
==ORIGIN
After the Theomachy, the remaining few survivors congregated at Aeternum. They decided that even though Aunox and its legions had been quelled, the soulfire threat still remained. Aunox still resided within the {Abyss} and was fighting Vaiya. The Ninth Legion had disappeared without a trace, with scouting parties yielding little to no findings. But most importantly, the warriors that were able to pose a threat to Aunox were either severely weakened or simply dead. To prepare for the uncertain future, the survivors decided to establish the Galactic Commonwealth to serve two functions: foster international relations between the {Newborn Races}, aiding them in understanding and growing with one another, and prepare the fledgling civilizations for any threat, whether it be intra- or extragalactic.
==STRUCTURE
=Assembly
The Assembly is composed of diplomats and representatives from both major and minor races. The Assemblage itself is a pseudo-virtual space meet to debate and dictate the operations of the Galactic Commonwealth. This is the primary governing body of the Galactic Commonwealth.
=Chanceries
The chanceries are courts where international and internal disputes are recognized and settled. Cases ranging from territorial disputes to war crimes are addressed here. The chanceries possess an ever-changing panel of judges who are assisted by specialized adjudicator intelligence.
=Offices
The Commonwealth offices are the various bureaucratic arms of the Commonwealth government, operating the various systems needed to keep the Commonwealth functional.
=Office of Chronology
While local time dominates in the daily affairs, it is also important to keep a galactic timetable and scale to keep affairs in order. The addition of relativistic effects and varying perceptions of time between species only added to the difficulty of such a task. To accomplish this, the Office of Chronology was founded. Their charge is to maintain the atomic clocks, ordering and composing the galactic calendar, and coordinating the various local times of the various nations composing the Galactic Commonwealth. The atomic clocks utilized by the Office of Chronology measure optical transitions in strontium atoms suspended in a near-perfectly stable environment. This means factors such as temperature, electromagnetism, and relativity are almost completely eliminated, allowing for more accurate timekeeping. Atomic clocks that meet Commonwealth standards are placed in nearly every single starship and structure for the sake of syncing with Central Aeternum Time. Central Aeternum Time is measured in cycles, but has been translated into human measurements for convenience and comprehension. The basic unit of a cycle can be likened to a third of a human second.
=Office of Informational Systems
To keep the Commonwealth connected, the Office of Informational Systems was founded. This office builds and maintains the various {ansibles} used for instantaneous communications throughout and beyond the galaxy. Members of this office work very closely with Kero of the {Scribes Consortium} due to the company’s mastery over ansible technology.
=Office of Interspecies Mediums
Interspecies and international relations are complicated affairs, as different species are attuned to different environments and cultures. What one species might see as beautiful music may cause seizures in another. This sort of physiological and cultural divides encourages isolation between species, breeding distrust and disunity. In an effort to quell such phenomena, the Office of Interspecies Mediums was established. This organization is focused on bridging the cultures of the Commonwealth's different member states. This can include initiatives such as translating and recording languages, deeming whether certain goods are safe for certain species, and constructing the universal library.
=Office of Foreign Affairs
While a majority of the nations of the galaxy are part of the Commonwealth, many decided to remain independent, such as the Concordat and the {Ikolae} Collectives. The Office of Foreign Affairs is responsible for maintaining good relations with these independent states by routinely sending ambassadors to them. They also deal with any matters related to extragalactic affairs.
=Office of Galactic Research
The Office of Galactic Research investigates and catalogs the various phenomena that occur within the galaxy. They aid in establishing international parks as well as codexing the various life forms on uninhabited worlds.
=Office of First Contact
The Office of First Contact keeps watch on the development of various fledgling races within the Milky Way and incorporates them into the Galactic Commonwealth.
=Office of Defense
The Office of Defense is the military section of the Commonwealth government. They help settle international disputes, guard key locations and assembly members, and prepare for the event of a galactic-scale threat.
=Office of Creation
The Office of Creation builds and maintains the various facilities utilized by the Commonwealth as well as constructing starships and weaponry utilized by the Office of Defense.
=Office of Logistics
The Office of Logistics keeps and updates the Galactic Orrery, a map of the galaxy containing various interstellar and {Void} transportation routes. They keep these highways clear of obstructions and construct waystations along these paths.
==MEMBERSHIP
To acquire membership within the Galactic Commonwealth, one must be contacted by a Commonwealth ambassador. Upon agreement to join the Commonwealth, a diplomatic party of the civilization is dispatched to Aeternum, where the majority of Commonwealth infrastructure is located. Upon the completion of discussion and agreement, the civilization in question is then officially recognized as a state of the Commonwealth and given a place in the Assembly. Joining the organization offers many benefits, including access to the Galactic Orrery, interweb integration, and access to intra and extragalactic affairs.
=States
Some of the states that comprise the Galactic Commonwealth include the {Mithraeho} Spheres, the {Sharhastian} Alliance, and, most recently, the Terran Union.
=Associated Organizations
Organizations such as the {Talaphrian Order} and the {Traders of the Wandering Sun} are heavily associated with the Galactic Commonwealth, but are not recognized as a member state. 
==FUNDING
While the Galactic Commonwealth accepts donations from its member states, the operations of the Commonwealth are largely self-sufficient. This is due to their capital being a stellar sphere, allowing for the extraction and utilization of a nearly unlimited amount of energy and resources.
==COMMONWEALTH LAW
Most member states are quite isolated and possess their own forms of rulership due to different species exhibiting different cultures and values. As a result, Commonwealth Law is generally quite accommodating and vague to account for xenorelativism. However, international locations within the Commonwealth, such as {Akanthe International Park} and Aeternum, possess their own sets of regulations determined by the Assembly. """
