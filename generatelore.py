article = """===MILKY WAY GALAXY
The Milky Way Galaxy, otherwise known as the Milky Way, is a 13.6 billion-year-old galaxy that is approximately 105,700 light-years in diameter and has a height of more than a thousand light-years. It contains several hundred billion stars and is centered by a supermassive black hole that weighs four million solar masses, known by humanity as Sagittarius A. This galaxy is the home of humanity, the galactic community, and the stories of Anima.
==RACES
Using the Theomachy as a reference, the races of the galaxy can be divided into three distinct groups.
=Bygone Races
The Bygone Races were the species and civilizations that were exterminated or fell due to the Theomachy.
=Elder Races
The Elder Races were the species and civilizations that have survived the Theomachy and live to the present day, albeit usually in a much more devolved state due to the various technological and informational collapses that took place during the Theomachy. Many of these Elder Races have also gone into a deep sleep or traveled to other galaxies.
=Newborn Races
The Newborn Races are the groups that achieved sophonthood and space flight after the Theomachy.
==FACTIONS
={Galactic Commonwealth}
The Galactic Commonwealth is the primary collection of nations within the Milky Way, consisting of groups such as the Mithraeho Spheres, Sharhastian Alliance, and Terran Union.
=Concordat
The Concordat is composed of three races of animium-based life, the Kalatari, the Arhima, and the Thosik. It was formed after the Animium Wars and the destruction of Kalathron as a means of building bridges between the species. While it is independent from the Galactic Commonwealth, the Concordat maintains good relations with the organization.
={Talaphrian Order}
The Talaphrian Order is a group of onturgists that have been present since before the Theomachy. They were led by Eyon, the Sword Saint but after it went into the Great Sleep, its avatar, the Sage, has been ruling the Knights in its stead. The organization and its subsidiaries maintain close cooperation with Aeternum and the Galactic Commonwealth due to its proximity to Aunox’s Prison.
={Karanaan}
The Karanaan are the largest mercantile combine of the galaxy, dominating the majority of intragalactic commerce. They are led by Lord Merchant Olande and are expansive, even possessing proxies in the Andromeda Galaxy.
={Ikolae Collectives}
The Ikolae Collectives are a sophont machine civilization currently existing in the Outlands. Due to their isolated location and different goals compared to the rest of the galaxy, they have remained a sovereign nation. However, they are not hostile towards the other civilizations, and regularly interact with the greater galactic community.
=Lorekeepers Guild
The Lorekeepers Guild is dedicated to collecting and maintaining all knowledge in the known universe. They are led by one of the Newborn onturgists, an artificial intelligence by the name of Dex’ Illur, the Threefold Mind.
==REGIONS
The galaxy is divided into four celestial regions of increasing distance from the galactic center. These are the Inner Core with a diameter of 20,000 light-years, the Outer Core with a diameter of 30,000 light-years, the Rim with a diameter of 50,000 light-years, and the Outlands, which are the gaps between galaxies.
==LOCATIONS
=Aeternum
Aeternum, the Infinite City, is the home of the Galactic Commonwealth. It is the hub for Commonwealth civilizations, containing key facilities such as the Assemblages and the Chanceries. It also serves as a bastion of defense for the greater galaxy, as it is situated close to an abyssal gate leading to Aunox’s Prison.
={Nexus}
The Nexus is a voidborne gigastructure built by an unknown race before the Theomachy. It is used as a form of faster than light travel and is controlled by sophont monitors known as pontificies.
=City of Three Peoples
The City of Three Peoples was built after the Animium Wars to act as a hub system where members of the {Kalatari}, Arhima, and Thosik could live in harmony. It contains key locations such as the {Silver Tower} and Arhimaian Directorate Brain.
=Kelleus
Kelleus is the homeworld of the Ikolae, originally serving as a wormhole-based heatsink before the Theomachy. Now, it is the hub system for all Ikolae Collectives and uplifted constructs.
==HISTORY
=Genesis
Before the first creatures crawled out of the Terran seas, the Elder Races were already taking to the stars. They were isolated on this slab of light, unfettered by each other's movements. Empowered by arcane energies and solar flame, they grew into races of demigods. By will alone, they built castles of light, tombs to ferry them to the end of time, and weapons that shook the fabric of reality. But, even demigods are afflicted with loneliness. In great numbers, they merged their bodies and minds. They gave themselves hearts of suns, skins of black holes, and somas of dead star-matter. The universe itself became their plaything, with time and space being bent into their instruments. This was the Age of Genesis, the God Age."""
