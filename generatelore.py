article = """===SILENT ELDER
In the gaps between galaxies, in a cold realm known as the Outlands, there resides engines that were constructed to bear their sleeping creators to the time when the stars have grown dim and the universe has grown cold. Their function is variable, with as many being tombs as prisons. Opening such pandoran vessels may awaken a benevolent god or a sleeping devil. One of these objects was discovered by the {Galactic Commonwealth} during a routine patrol for extragalactic threats. It was a smooth sphere of onyx coloration with at least three hundred kilometers in diameter. Upon approaching the object, black figures arose straight from the surface of the sphere as if it were a liquid and lunged at the party, cutting off all further transmissions. Whatever this object was, it was hostile, and it possessed the capability to destroy an entire flotilla of Commonwealth scout ships. A larger fleet was dispatched by the Department of Defense to contain the area and further monitor the object. However, all attempts were again met with hostility, forcing the fleet to voidjump away from the area. The Assembly decided that their ships were not equipped to deal with such a  threat, leading them to turn to the {Talaphrian Order} for aid.
Five Knights Talaphria were contracted to investigate, and if possible, exterminate the entity. Upon arrival, thousands upon thousands of onyx warriors were launched from the sphere, firing at the knights with various weapons of hardlight. These attempts failed, and the warriors retreated into the structure. The knights didnâ€™t dare engage with the object, eyeing it warily during the calm. This calm was cut short, however, when an orifice of pale light opened on the sphere. From it emerged a figure approximately ten meters tall and clad in black spheres. It regarded the knights for a brief moment, before summoning an array of antineutronium orbs, a form of weapon not seen since the Theomachy. In nanoseconds, the projectiles were fired at the knights at speeds nearing the speed of light. The knights were only able to react quickly enough to dampen the blow with rudimentary shields, resulting in the damage weakening them severely. With their remaining strength, they attacked the entity before it could recover its weaponry, trying to tear it asunder with rapid voidslashes. The entity suffered extreme damage, and seemed to sense that its loss was inevitable. It destroyed its home in a great conflagration which killed itself in the process. When the knights recovered, the body and the sphere were gone, supposedly annihilated from the blast. An observer ship recorded this entire ordeal, documenting it as one of the first cases where an Elder was awoken from its tomb. From then on, all structures of this construction were quarantined and made inaccessible to the public."""
