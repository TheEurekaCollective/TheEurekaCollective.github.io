article = """===PARAPHYSICS DIVISION
The Paraphysics Division (PD) is a research organization dedicated to studying and utilizing {paraphysical forces}. While mostly shrouded in mystery to the common person, the technologies and techniques that have been developed by the PD can be seen all over the Human Domain. From gravitic drives to {spell rifles}, the work of the PD has helped humankind reach new technological heights.
==HISTORY
The Paraphysics Division (PD) has its roots in several different nations from the Pre-Unification Era. Some of these include the USA’s Federal Bureau of Paraphysics, the USSR’s State Research Center of Koltsovo, and the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. After the Terran Accords, these institutes were merged into the Paraphysics Division of the Terran Union. The founders of this institution were Johannes Siddhar and Solana Igarashi due to them being the foremost scientists concerning paraphysics, with their research and papers serving as the foundation for thaumatology. More specifically, it was Siddhar’s “Esoteric Energies and Their Properties” and Igarashi’s “Theory of Conceptual Particle Interactions” that spurred the discovery and subsequent manipulation of psions, infons, and mana. In the late 21st century, the existence of paraphysical phenomena was revealed to the general public, with information dissemination campaigns heavily monitored by the PD.
==ORGANIZATION
When the PD was first founded, it was just a combination of independent organizations working in unison from what used to be different nations. However, this was later changed when the organizations were officially merged. Now, the PD is jointly led by a Chief Administrator, the Executive Council, and their respective AI. The organization is divided into sections which are further divided into departments. Sections are led by Section Directors while departments are led by Department Heads. Personnel of the division can also be split into various authorization tiers, with Alpha being the highest form of clearance.
==COMPOSITION
=Administration Sector
_Chief Administrator
The Chief Administrator is the leader of the Paraphysics Division and Administration Sector. One leader is chosen every decade, though there is no term limit. The CA has knowledge of all activities in the Paraphysics Division and is paired with Intendant Eureka, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI).
_Executive Council
The Executive Council is composed of the leaders of every sector and their partner AIs. They each possess one vote in the organization while the CA possesses two votes.
_Department of External Affairs (DEA)
The DEA Handles both foreign and Terran policy related to paraphysics.
_Department of Internal Affairs (DIA)
The DIA is charged with self-policing the Paraphysics Division. This includes rooting out potential traitors as well as enforcing Division law.
=Information Control Sector (ICS)
_Department of Intelligence (DOI)
The DOI finds and monitors the activities of potential threats and reacts accordingly.
_Department of Communications (DOC)
The DOC monitors public knowledge about paraphysics and finding potential threats on the interwebs. They were also responsible for the information dissemination campaigns that exposed the greater population to paraphysics.
_Department of Records (DOR)
The DOR is responsible for storing, maintaining, and purging Division records.
=Research and Technology Sector (RTS)
_Department of Paraphysics (DOP)
The DOP researches paraphysical artifacts and phenomena for further application.
_Department of Engineering (DOE)
The DOE develops both normal and paraphysical technologies for use by the Division.
_Department of Intelligence Research (DOIR)
The DOIR controls and creates AIs and ghosts.
_Department of Bioengineering and Neural Sciences (DOBNS)
The DOBNS creates the technology necessary to manufacture mages and their equipment. They are also in charge of the Jovian Cloning Facilities.
=Maintenance and Creation Sector (MCS)
_Department of Accounting (DOA)
The DOA manages and distributes the various resources within the Division.
_Department of Logistics (DOL)
The DOL is in charge of transporting Division personnel and goods across the Terran Union.
_Department of Security (DOS)
The DOS protects the various vaults and facilities of the Division.
_Department of Manufacturing (DOM)
The DOM creates the gear, constructs, and structures needed to run the Division.
_Department of Resources (DORS)
The DORS collects raw materials for use in manufacturing. They make extensive use of mining drones and self-replicating robots.
={Magus} Sector
_Department of Intendants
The Department of Intendants is charged with maintaining and controlling intendant mages.
_Department of Pilots
The Department of Pilots is charged with maintaining and controlling pilot mages.
_{Department of Combat}
The Department of Combat is charged with maintaining and controlling combat mages."""
