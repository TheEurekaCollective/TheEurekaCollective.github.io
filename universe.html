		<span class="underline"></span>
		<p class="universeparagraph">Project Anima is a science-fantasy universe set in a future of science and magic. It takes place in an alternate timeline where the branch of paraphysics known as thaumaturgy had been rediscovered by scientists during the mid-twentieth century. Project Anima follows humanity as it grows and explores the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

		<p class="universeheading">Origin</p>
		<span class="underline"></span>
		<p class="universeparagraph">Ever since I was a young child, science fiction and fantasy universes had always captivated me. I loved the SCP Foundation for its mystique and horror, Warhammer 40k for its grimdark setting and sheer brutality, and the Destiny universe for its mixture of magic and technology. These were just some of the worlds that I spent my time delving into. When the coronavirus pandemic struck, I was forced to spend a large amount of time indoors with nothing to do. That was when I had one thought: “Magic and guns”. It was a narrow thought, but it eventually served as the seed for the universe would become Project Anima.</p>
