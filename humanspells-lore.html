		<h1 id='human-spells'>HUMAN SPELLS</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Spells are the foundation of <a class='infolink' href='paraphysics-lore#thaumatology'>thaumaturgy</a>, serving as which thaumaturgical phenomena are generated. They are energy-information packages composed of psions and mana, cast from devices known as emitters.</p>
		<h2 id='history'>HISTORY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>During the age of <a class='infolink' href='humanthaumatology-lore#ancient-thaumatology'>Ancient Thaumatology</a>, methods of spell composition and casting often took the form of various written formulas and verbal chants. Thaumaturgists of this time believed that the formulas and chants themselves caused the phenomena to occur, leading to inconsistent or inefficient casting. In reality, the formulas and chants guide the caster’s thoughts to produce the thaumaturgical phenomenon. This was later realized during the age of <a class='infolink' href='humanthaumatology-lore#modern-thaumatology'>Modern Thaumatology</a> and improved upon using various technologies such as neural extension and cognition improvement.</p>
		<h2 id='ritual'>RITUAL</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A ritual is a process in which spells are composed and cast. This specific outlined process details a technologically assisted ritual, the most common method in the year 2570.</p>
		<h3 id='acquisition'>Acquisition</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A thaumaturgist mentally designates a system in a specific location. This system is where the psions are going to impact the infons.</p>
		<h3 id='calculation'>Calculation</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>An AI scans the system and makes an approximation as to the number of particles present in it. Calculations are then made to determine the present physical properties of each particle and what they will be after the spell has affected them. Once the property solutions are calculated, the AI will send them to the neural interface of the thaumaturgist.</p>
		<h3 id='translation'>Translation</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The neural interface accepts and translates the property solution into information that the thaumaturgist's brain will understand.</p>
		<h3 id='psion-generation'>Psion Generation</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The translated property solutions are interpreted by the brain and translated into psions.</p>
		<h3 id='spell-collection'>Spell Collection</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Mana and psions are pooled into an information and energy package, officially becoming a spell.</p>
		<h3 id='spell-delivery'>Spell Delivery</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The spell is either sent unassisted or with an emitter towards the desired target. Due to the lightspeed nature of psions and mana, as well as them exclusively interacting with conceptual particles, a spell-making impact with its target seems to be a spontaneous phenomenon to the average onlooker. For example, a thaumaturgist making use of a fire spell might launch the spell from their wand, but instead of leaving a visible flaming trail, it simply appears at the target at the speed of light.</p>
		<h2 id='spell-compendium'>SPELL COMPENDIUM</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='fusion-point'>Fusion Point</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Fusion Point is a spell that compresses atomic nuclei in a specific area into a much smaller area, forcing fusion reactions to occur. This spell is used widely in both combat as well as energy production.</p>
		<h3 id='atmospheric-repulsion'>Atmospheric Repulsion</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Atmospheric Repulsion is a spell that actively pushes air away from the emitter. This is especially useful in both increasing the aerodynamicness of atmospheric craft and acting as a form of propulsion.</p>
		<h3 id='material-compression'>Material Compression</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Material Compression is a spell that increases the density of particles within a target system. This can be used to increase the sharpness of a blade, reinforce physical armor, or even synthesize hyperelements.</p>
		<h3 id='ionize'>Ionize</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ionize is a spell that converts particles in a system into a plasma, which could be turned into a weapon or as a form of energy shielding.</p>
		<h3 id='hardlight'>Hardlight</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Hardlight is a spell that forces photons in a given system to slow down to a crawl, which forces them to gain mass. This creates a form of solid light, which is incredibly useful in fields such as quantum computing, superconductor development, and lightspeed weapons development.</p>
		<h3 id='psionic-interference'>Psionic Interference</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Psionic Interference is a spell that utilizes a caster’s own psions to interfere with another caster’s psions. This could be used in surveillance to detect when spells are being cast as well as used to interfere with spells in a specific area, creating a form of area denial.</p>
		<h2 id='scaling'>SCALING</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Most casting methods can be divided into two categories: static and scalar. While static spells are able to bypass the computation phase of casting, they aren’t adaptive as they produce almost the same phenomenon every time they are casted. However, they can be chained and combined to produce varied effects in a small amount of time. Meanwhile, scalar spells utilize the computation phase to create a spell uniquely suited to a certain situation, meaning lower rates of casting but higher degrees of potency.</p>
