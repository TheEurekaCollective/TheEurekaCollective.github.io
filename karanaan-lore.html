		<h1 id='karanaan'>KARANAAN</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Karanaan, otherwise known as the Traders of the Wandering Sun, are a collective of organizations dedicated to building wealth both in and out of the galaxy. Led by Lord-Merchant Olande, the Karanaan hold sway over the large majority of logistics and financial institutions within the galaxy. While they are highly associated with the <a class='infolink' href='galacticcommonwealth-lore'>Galactic Commonwealth</a> and other galactic governments, they are not part of any, allowing them to maintain their sovereignty amidst galactic politics.</p>
		<h2 id='history'>HISTORY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>To fill the vacuum in infrastructure left behind by the <a class='infolink' href='milkywaygalaxy-lore#bygone-races'>Bygone Races</a> after the Theomachy, the Karanaan was founded. Seven guilds of wandering nomads, each with their own stellar engine, merged under a single banner. Each guild of the Karanaan held equal authority in the collective, with each relying on the others to maintain their own operations at their full capacity. However, the Ascendance of the Head Chairman of Zvrenda Holdings, Olande, disrupted the status quo. Given this new power, Olande reformed the Karanaan to the one that exists during the modern-day.</p>
		<h2 id='organization'>ORGANIZATION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Karanaan are a septet of organizations bound together by Lord-Merchant Olande, Head Chairman of Zvrenda Holdings. Acting in unison, they could be considered one of the most powerful organizations within the Milky Way, with either themselves or their proxies being present in almost every galactic affair.</p>
		<h3 id='zvrenda-holdings'>Zvrenda Holdings</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Zvrenda Holdings is the primary shareholder for all the organizations within the Karanaan, allowing it to posit itself as the collective leader. Led by Lord-Merchant Olande, it is the glue that binds all the different organizations together into a single force. While many initially despised Olande’s takeover of the Karanaan, Olande’s masterful leadership and strength took the collective to new heights and profits, rapidly regaining the support of the guilds.</p>
		<h3 id='fellowship-of-voidwalkers'>Fellowship of Voidwalkers</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Fellowship of Voidwalkers controls almost all commerce that occurs within the <a class='infolink' href='nexus-lore'>Nexus</a>, save for other major organizations such as the Ikujo Family. They are charged with forging pacts with pontifices as well as charting new pathways within the Nexus. </p>
		<h3 id='society-of-silver-scales'>Society of Silver Scales</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Society of Silver Scales is the primary bank for the Galactic Commonwealth and many smaller governments, charged with keeping track of currency as well as maintaining exchange rates between various currencies.</p>
		<h3 id='aukhukr-logistics'>Aukhukr Logistics</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Aukhukr Logistics is one of the largest corporations within the Karanaan, possessing the most expansive merchant fleets known in the galaxy. This is due to their many services and charges, including transportation of goods and people, monitoring and maintaining the various waystations and wormhole gates, as well as charting new transportation routes for the galactic community.</p>
		<h3 id='ergotan-international'>Ergotan International</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ergotan International is a private military corporation that not only protects the Karanaan’s interests but also serves as Olande’s private army. They have their own weapons research divisions, allowing them to stay equipped with the most advanced technologies to bring into battle.</p>
		<h3 id='vlahir-communications'>Vlahir Communications</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Vlahir Communications monitors and maintains the wormhole communications technology that composes twenty-three percent of the galactic interweb.</p>
		<h3 id='taekoti-mining-and-manufacturing'>Taekoti Mining and Manufacturing</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Taekoti Mining and Manufacturing (TMM) acquires the resources and produces the various goods needed to keep the Karanaan operational. They own expansive fleets of starlifters, automated mining platforms, and even forge worlds, megastructures dedicated to the single act of production for the Karanaan.</p>
		<h2 id='locations'>LOCATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The hubs of the Karanaan are stellar engines, machines held to a godlike status within the collective. They number seven, with each of the guilds controlling one. To enable the travel of these gargantuan constructs, each guild must dedicate their engine power to the traveling star in question. The foremost of these engines is Tykupiel, the Resplendent Aster. It is nearly 200 million kilometers in diameter, serving as Olande’s flagship and the home of Zvrenda Holdings.</p>
