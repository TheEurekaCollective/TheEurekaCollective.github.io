		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The world of Kalathron revolved around a cruel sun. Great waves of plasma would sweep across the planet, cursing those it came in contact with. However, life found a way to survive, not on the surface, but within deep caverns. From above, stone skies shielded life from the scorching rays, allowing only what was necessary to pass through. From below, volcanic vents would feed the various flora and fauna, allowing life to eventually advance to that of a sophont species, a reptilian race known as the Skago. They were a collection of primitive tribes, distributed throughout the myriad continents of the planet. One of these tribes called themselves the <a class='infolink' href='kalatari-lore#prinor'>Prinor</a>. They were hunters, slayers of great beasts. They adorned their bodies with the remnants of such beasts, so that their strength may be known to all. It was them who would first grasp the art of steel magic and bestow upon themselves iron flesh.</p>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Tales speak of the Fallen Star breaking through the stone sky, its body coming to rest at an underground lake near a Prinor settlement. The greatest of this tribe was Grand Matron Talavale, the Dragonslayer. Talavale, curious as to what had fallen from the Lands above, led her people into the murky depths of the lake. Through the deep water, she was able to see liquid light pouring from a metal husk, permeating throughout the lake. Talavale reached out her hand, for she had never seen such a beautiful sight before. When she did, she was enveloped with golden lightning. It began changing her, with a halo of hardlight manifesting itself above her head. Through a great trial of pain, her body was made anew. Steel scales replaced ivory plates, her bones gained strength rivaling that of iron. Images from a thousand lives flooded her mind. She saw stars grow dim and die. She touched the voids of space and felt what came at the edge of the cosmos. When the process was over, she finally understood; the body before her was not of this age, or even of this world. It was old, much older than even the heroes of the past. She gave the husk before her a name: Kalatar, the Fallen Star. It would serve as the god of her people, the Firstborn. But most of all, Talavale was no more; she was now Revelator Scyanthus, Mouth of the Fallen Star. Legions of living iron marched across the continents, spreading the blessings of Kalatar for the next 1,000 years. When this was done, the Skago people were no longer. They were known by a new name: the <a class='infolink' href='kalatari-lore'>Kalatari</a>, Children of the Fallen Star. </p>
