		<h1 id='ygirin'>YGIRIN</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ygirin, otherwise known as Star Children, is an umbrella term used to refer to organisms that are born due to the pressures and energies that exist within stars. These forces amalgamate and entangle collections of cosmic strings, creating a Ygirin. As they grow and mature by accumulating more “energy-mass”, they move towards the surface of their host stars. This process can take thousands of years. However, they eventually die due to them reaching the surface and being ejected from their host stars.</p>
		<h2 id='history'>HISTORY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The first documented case of a Ygirin was sometime during the early <a class='infolink' href='galacticcommonwealth-lore'>Commonwealth</a> period. A group of Xweili scientists were exploring the inner workings of a star utilizing a plasma probe when one of the probe’s scanners detected a series of psionic emissions originating from within the star. Electromagnetic imaging showed a miniscule amorphous blob of higher density compared to the surrounding area. This news was brought to the attention of the Bureau of Astrobiology, who then officially catalogued the species in the Galactic Codex.</p>
		<h2 id='biology'>BIOLOGY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='composition'>Composition</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ygirin lack the specialized structures that most other species have. Their bodies are entirely homogeneous, with all their functions distributed throughout their bodies.</p>
		<h3 id='growth-and-development'>Growth and Development</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ygirin consume plasma and nuclear matter to grow themselves. Given enough material, they can grow indefinitely. Over time, a Ygirin gains a stronger grasp over electromagnetism as well as increases in intelligence.</p>
		<h2 id='society'>SOCIETY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Since it is very rare for more than a few Ygirin to exist within a star at a single time, most Ygirin are naturally antisocial. However, some of the sophont Ygirin have been able to form relationships with others.</p>
		<h2 id='rarity'>RARITY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ygirin are extremely rare due to the very specialized conditions that involve their emergence. As a result, only a few thousand Ygirin have been detected within the Milky Way.</p>
		<h2 id='ygirin-hunting'>YGIRIN HUNTING</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Ygirin hunting is an extremely profitable practice as wealthy individuals and laboratories are willing to pay exorbitant amounts of credits to acquire a specimen. Hunters of Ygirin are known as plasma fishers. The Fields of Aster, a region of the galaxy heavily populated with stars, is a hotspot for Ygirin hunters.</p>
		<h2 id='yigirin-extraction'>YIGIRIN EXTRACTION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>To collect a Ygirin, a gravitic net is deployed into its host star. This net then pulls the Ygirin into a Fusion Matrix. This matrix is essentially a collection area for plasma to keep the Ygirin alive. It is also electromagnetically shielded to prevent the Ygirin from interacting with the outside world.</p>
		<h2 id='sophonthood'>SOPHONTHOOD</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>While the majority are non-sophont in terms of intelligence, there have been four notable instances of a sophont Ygirin occurring naturally. They are known as Khepri, Ptah, Hathor, and Aten. To interact with the world, they utilize a modular fusion matrix, which adapts to any form the Ygirin desires.</p>
		<h2 id='notable-individuals'>NOTABLE INDIVIDUALS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Groundsmaster Aten of the <a class='infolink' href='talaphrianorder-lore'>Talaphrian Order</a> is one of the oldest groundmasters within the Order. It has been part of the order since the pre-war era, meaning that it was a veteran of the War of the Disk. Aten’s most prolific achievement was destroying General Ohu of the Second Legion.</p>
		<h2 id='known-owners'>KNOWN OWNERS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Lord-Merchant Olande: The long life of the leader of the <a class='infolink' href='karanaan-lore'>Karanaan</a> has allowed it to collect multiple Ygirin. The most prominent in its collection is the one that resides within the capstone of Olande’s Scepter. It is an infinitely mirrored gem, creating a “star within star” visual effect. </p>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Commonwealth Public Athenaeum is known to have a Ygirin exhibit.</p>
