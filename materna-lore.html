		<h1 id='materna'>MATERNA</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Materna is one of the largest companies in the biotechnology sector and focuses on providing services such as cloning, prenatal modification, and artificial births. They are a subsidiary of Faber Technologies and have existed since the mid-21st century. They utilize the trademark Variable-Organic Printing Apparatuses, otherwise known as BioTubes, to grow and modify organics.</p>
		<h2 id='operations'>OPERATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Materna is an extremely large corporation and has stakes in almost every portion of the human technologies sector. Materna facilities could be found in almost every landside or spaceside city.</p>
		<h3 id='artificial-births'>Artificial Births</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The primary focus of Materna’s operations is the artificial birthing clinics. These are facilities where babies are grown and modified. To begin the fully automated process, genetic samples are extracted from the parents and are mixed to create a genetic template. Desired genes are added and undesired genes are removed. The genetic template is then codified for storage. An embryo is generated based on the genetic template and placed within an artificial uterus. This artificial uterus is made of advanced polymers and has both a tailored life support system and monitoring sensors to ensure that the baby grows up healthy and any complications during the growing process are addressed quickly. The growing period usually takes nine months, but people with a Class 3 or greater subscription can have it decreased up to merely two months.</p>
		<h3 id='cloning'>Cloning</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>While human cloning is officially banned, organs and pets can be cloned. Organs are not only made to replace existing organs, but also act as an additive. It is not uncommon to see a person with a redundant heart or extra kidney. Artificially created organs, such as hyperlungs and endocrine manipulators, are popular. Pets can also be created with specific traits in mind, some being completely unnatural. Crimson retrievers and great chihuahuas are some of the pets that have been made possible.</p>
		<h3 id='biotube'>BioTube</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Materna’s state-of-the-art BioTubes are containers that are suitable for the culturing and duplicating of cells. They are essentially printers for organics.</p>
		<h3 id='gene-and-gamete-hosting'>Gene and Gamete Hosting</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Many families have their entire genetic lineages hosted within the Genetic Banks of Materna.</p>
		<h3 id='genetic-modifications'>Genetic Modifications</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>People can pay to have specific snippets of their genetic code removed or added to.</p>
		<h3 id='medicine'>Medicine</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Medical BioTubes not only have the capacity to culture cells but also heal injured cells. Injured individuals are placed into a deep sleep and are submerged in a nutrient mix. Specially-made viruses are then injected into the system to perform operations on the individual. After the treatment, an individual takes a pill that sends a kill code to the viruses, which are promptly decomposed and excreted.</p>
		<h3 id='gene-tagging'>Gene Tagging</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Almost all biological products of Materna possess the Materna Genetic Tag. This isolated section of artificial genetic code marks the product as originating from the Materna corporation.</p>
		<h2 id='business-model'>BUSINESS MODEL</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Most people have their entire families placed in the hands of Materna. In fact, a child, her mother, and her grandmother might have all been grown in the same BioTube. There are two ways that people can pay for Materna’s services: one-time fees and subscriptions. However, one-time fees are unusual as usage of Materna and their ecosystem is quite common. There are six classes of subscription services, each offering a different set of benefits and services. Organizations such as <a class='infolink' href='madamemartins-lore'>Madame Martins</a> can also take advantage of organic growth capacity.</p>
		<h3 id='class-1'>Class 1</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>For a Class 1 Subscription, one person can get cells, gametes, and gene hosting. This is the first, and only free, tier of Materna subscriptions.</p>
		<h3 id='class-2'>Class 2</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>For a Class 2 subscription, one person can get 25 kilograms of cellular matter made a year.</p>
		<h3 id='class-3'>Class 3</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>For a Class 3 subscription, one person can get 50 kilograms of cellular matter made a year.</p>
		<h3 id='class-4'>Class 4</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>For a Class 4 subscription, one person can get 100 kilograms of cellular matter made a year and a spot in the Expedited Medical Program.</p>
		<h3 id='class-5'>Class 5</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>For a Class 5 subscription, one person can get Priority Medical Pickup, Priority Medical Biotube Reservation, Priority Organ Replacement, Yearly Organ Upgrades, and unlimited kilograms of cellular matter made a year.</p>
		<h3 id='organization-class'>Organization Class</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>This is the most expensive, but offers lower rates for employees of the organizations as well as incredibly cheap cellular matter growth rates.</p>
