		<h1 id='ti23-mining-barge'>TI23 MINING BARGE</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The TI23 Mining Barge is a resource acquisition vessel developed by Terwa Industrial and produced by Ascella Shipyards within the system of Sol. It is one of the most widely used mining vehicles within the Human Domain due to its modularity and efficient design.</p>
		<h2 id='development'>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The engineers of Terwa Industrial wanted to make an adaptive mining platform that was backward compatible with other currently existing products within the Terwa Industrial ecosystem. They thus devised the TI23 Mining Barge, a modular and efficient drone platform that could mine everything from the smallest asteroid to the largest planetesimals. It was made with the idea that profits aren’t made on the base vehicle, as it is sold at a loss. Instead, money is made from the sale of various parts and services compatible with the TI23 ecosystem.  They then outsourced the production of the platform and its components to Ascella Shipyards, one of the largest shipbuilding corporations within the Human Domain. Primary production of the vehicle takes place in the Ascella Orbital Shipyards of Mars.</p>
		<h2 id='composition'>COMPOSITION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The baseline TI23 Mining Barge is composed of two sets of <a class='infolink' href='antimatter-lore'>antimatter</a> drives, a Size-M raw materials tub, and a single platform of drone launch bays. This platform would act as both a carrier and a charging station. The drones would be equipped with a single set of antimatter drives and a helical mining laser.</p>
		<h2 id='attachments-&-upgrades'>ATTACHMENTS & UPGRADES</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Both the barge and the drones it utilizes can be upgraded. However, the drone and barge systems are not cross-compatible with one another.</p>
		<h3 id='barge'>Barge</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The barge can be upgraded with a reinforced and enlarged chassis to allow more room for additional upgrades. This could include increased fuel tank reserves, larger cargo containers, faster drives, improved sensor suites, larger and more energy-efficient drone platforms, and even a small drone repair unit.</p>
		<h3 id='drones'>Drones</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Drones can be equipped with various upgrades such as stronger mining lasers, more precise magnetic field generators, and even the ability to link up with other drones in its collective to combine their lasers and mine harder-to-extract materials more effectively.</p>
		<h2 id='operations'>OPERATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The most common application of the TI23 Mining Barge is mining the Kuiper belt in Sol System. Fleets of these vessels would be deployed with a foreman AI and a skeleton crew of engineers and scientists that would act in the event of a failure or emergency. After the mining barges are spread out and their charges allocated, drones will be deployed to target specific asteroids or groups of asteroids. Each drone will utilize ablative mining lasers to burn desired material off of the objects. After the materials are ionized by the mining lasers, electric fields pull the material into the drones’ storage tanks. Once their tanks are full, the drones will return to the mining barge and dump their extracted material into the barge’s containers. After filling up the barge’s containers, the drones will return to their dock and recharge for their next mission. The barge itself will then transport the raw material to its assigned dock or factory.</p>
