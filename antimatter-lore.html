		<h1 id='antimatter'>ANTIMATTER</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Within the Human Domain, antimatter is the primary form of energy production and storage. From cities to starships, antimatter powers almost every aspect of life. It is even used as a currency and is stored in special containment units colloquially dubbed "wells."</p>
		<h2 id='production'>PRODUCTION</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='step-1---collecting-energy'>Step 1 - Collecting Energy</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The production of antimatter within the Sol system begins at various stations of New Heliopolis, a series of interconnected solar colonies that have an orbit close to that of Mercury’s. It serves both as the staging ground for the Dyson Project and the central base of operations for the Laser Energy Transport Grid.</p>
		<h4 id='dyson-project'>Dyson Project</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Dyson Project is a long-running initiative to partially cover Sol with an array of mirrors, which will funnel the collected light into tight beams and send them to antimatter production facilities around the system. To do this, material is lifted directly from the surface of the star using strong magnetic fields. Then, manufacturing drones convert this raw material into ultra-thin reflective panels, which become the robotic mirrors that collect and send light throughout the system.</p>
		<h4 id='laser-energy-transport-grid'>Laser Energy Transport Grid</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Laser Energy Transport Grid (LETG) is a series of facilities that collect and distribute laser energy throughout the system. Hundreds of these facilities are scattered throughout the Sol System to account for celestial bodies blocking the path of the lasers. The path of these lasers end in various factories dedicated to producing various goods, including that of antimatter.</p>
		<h3 id='step-2---synthesis'>Step 2 - Synthesis</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>At various orbital antimatter plants around the solar system, particle accelerators generate antimatter. This antimatter is then shipped off to various locations or fed to their destination via direct pipeline.</p>
		<h3 id='step-3---storage'>Step 3 - Storage</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A hermetically sealed container known as a well is used to store antimatter safely. It generates a strong internal magnetic field to suspend the antimatter within the center of a vacuum, preventing the substance from making contact with the matter composing the container. The magnetic field can also be manipulated so that the antimatter moves along a designated path. Antimatter pipelines are based on this principle.</p>
		<h2 id='applications'>APPLICATIONS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<h3 id='energy'>Energy</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Antimatter is used as a portable fuel source for most constructs, including mages and starships which utilize mana-catalyzed antimatter reactors to produce usable energy. These reactors can be miniaturized down to the size of a marble with the aid of paraphysical techniques.</p>
		<h3 id='antimatter-credit'>Antimatter Credit</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Long before the 26th century, currency became regarded as simply an analogue for time and energy, so when the technology became available, it made sense to turn energy itself into currency. Antimatter as a currency is referred to as the antimatter credit. This comes in two forms: the physical antimatter credit and the virtual antimatter credit. While the physical antimatter credit is a physical amount of antimatter, the virtual antimatter credit refers to the amount of energy a person can use.</p>
		<h3 id='weaponry'>Weaponry</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Projectiles and missiles, such as antimatter warheads, are highly present within the Human Domain’s arsenal.</p>
		<h2 id='security'>SECURITY</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Producing antimatter always yields less energy than is invested. This alone greatly deters counterfeiting, but even if counterfeiters attempt antimatter production, the energy signatures generated would easily be picked up by scanners.</p>
