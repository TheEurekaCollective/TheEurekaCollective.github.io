		<h1 id='chassis'>CHASSIS</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A <a class='infolink' href='combatmages-lore'>combat mage</a>’s chassis is its body and its method of interaction with the environment. The chassis is a biomechanical frame that is composed of the most advanced materials produced by the <a class='infolink' href='paraphysicsdivision-lore'>Paraphysics Division</a>. New versions of chassis are always being generated by the designer AI of the Research and Technology Sector.</p>
		<h2 id='bases'>BASES</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Bases are biomechanical bodies that Central Cognition Cores (CCC) can be inserted into. These CCC’s can adapt to suit special situations, but the most commonly used version is the General Utility Combat Chassis (GUCC).</p>
		<h3 id='hard-systems'>Hard Systems</h3>
		<h4 id='nanolaminate-plating-and-superstructure'>Nanolaminate Plating and Superstructure</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The material used to form the outer shell and superstructure is known as nanolaminate. Nanolaminate is composed of micron-scale layers of varying elements and compounds. These layers are placed on top of each other in different orientations to induce different properties while also accomplishing high density. These layers can be modified to induce thermal resistance, thermal dispersion, impact toughness, malleability, and other properties.</p>
		<h4 id='artificial-muscles'>Artificial Muscles</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The current generation of chassis utilizes an artificial muscular system that is composed of a liquid-metal matrix which changes its structure based on the level of electrical charge. This allows for remarkable flexibility and strength in an incredibly small volume.</p>
		<h3 id='soft-systems'>Soft Systems</h3>
		<h4 id='somatic-threads'>Somatic Threads</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A combat mage’s somatic threads are a four-bundled system of wires that transfer mana, psions, data, and power throughout the chassis. The threads are especially thin and have the ability to extrude out of specific orifices in a chassis so a combat mage can interface with certain technologies.</p>
		<h2 id='modular-armature-system-(mas)'>MODULAR ARMATURE SYSTEM (MAS)</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The MAS is an essential part of most chassis. They allow for a single base to be adapted to a multitude of mission profiles.</p>
		<h3 id='nanite-nodes'>Nanite Nodes</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Nanite nodes are extrusion points where nanites can exit the nanopod to execute tasks. They are incredibly small and are two-fold hermetically sealed.</p>
		<h3 id='digitigrade-legs'>Digitigrade Legs</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>For increased agility and mobility, the digitigrade leg option is available. To compensate for the inherent shortcomings of digitigrade legs, there is the option of adding support pads that increase the surface area of the foot. The feet of these legs are also inherently modular, allowing them to form any sort of underfoot from snowshoes to noise-dampening padding.</p>
		<h3 id='power-limbs'>Power Limbs</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Power limbs are stronger than Manipular limbs, but lack the manipular limbs’ precision. They can be categorized into two subtypes:</p>
		<h4 id='jointed-limbs'>Jointed Limbs</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>While greater in strength than non-jointed limbs, they are weaker in terms of flexibility.</p>
		<h4 id='non-jointed-limbs'>Non-Jointed Limbs</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>While stronger in flexibility than jointed limbs, they are weaker in terms of strength.</p>
		<h3 id='manipular-limbs'>Manipular Limbs</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Manipular limbs are weak yet nimble compared to their power limb counterparts. They are covered in nanite nodes to allow nanites to form the best complement of whatever the limb needs to interface with. This creates artificial cilia that allow for manipulation on a microscopic level. Manipulars can also come equipped with a series of tech interface fingers, allowing combat mages to physically tap into a large number of electronic and mechanical systems.</p>
		<h3 id='flight-packages'>Flight Packages</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Flight packages allow the combat mage to achieve flight. The most popular is the Njordian Flight Unit, a series of repulsor-type thrusters mounted on flexible limbs for maximum agility while in the air.</p>
		<h2 id='utility-slots'>UTILITY SLOTS</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Utility slots and their complementary utility modules are the primary functional components of a combat mage’s chassis.</p>
		<h3 id='central-cognition-core-(ccc)'>Central Cognition Core (CCC)</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The CCC is the main brain of any mage. It is where the anchor resides, and thus where mana and psions are generated. As a result, the psionic threads are linked directly to this unit. The CCC and the computation module have the option of being ex-situ but at the cost of response speeds and increased latency.</p>
		<h3 id='computation-module'>Computation Module</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Computation modules host maintenance subsystems as well as the assistant AI.</p>
		<h3 id='sensor-and-communications-suite-(scs)'>Sensor and Communications Suite (SCS)</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The SCS allows access to not only mage-to-ship communications but also affords the combat mage a series of sensory capabilities. On top of heightened baseline senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing), SCS’s are afforded a series of other senses depending on the sensory package. These other senses include, but are not limited to magnetoreception, thermography, object bypass vision (OBV), electroreception, and psioreception. Drones with additional points of view, as well as the mothership, can provide additional sensory data and improve situational awareness.</p>
		<h3 id='mana-catalyzed-micro-antimatter-reactor-(mcmar)'>Mana-Catalyzed Micro Antimatter Reactor (MCMAR)</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The MCMAR is a modular portable power supply that fuels both the combat mage’s chassis and wand. The MCMAR utilizes hydrogen-antihydrogen reactions to ensure that combat mages and their weapons are capable of operating unassisted for years on end.</p>
		<h3 id='nanite-pod-(nanopod)'>Nanite Pod (Nanopod)</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>A nanite pod contains a single swarm of nanites. These nanites could be used for a variety of tasks such as machine interfacing, fine manipulation, and temporary repair.</p>
		<h3 id='auxiliary-life-support-(als)'>Auxiliary Life Support (ALS)</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>In extreme cases, the CCC can be ejected and supported by the ALS until retrieval by extraction teams. </p>
