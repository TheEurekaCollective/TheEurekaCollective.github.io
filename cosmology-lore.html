		<h1 id='cosmology'>COSMOLOGY</h1>
		<span class='underline1'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Within the Outside, there resides a being. It is known by many names, but its most prominent is It Who Sleeps, otherwise referred to as the Dreamer. It is a being that undergoes the same repeated cycle of slumber and wakefulness. By dreaming, it undergoes a process of creating Existences, and by waking, it undergoes a process of destroying them. Countless Existences have been fashioned and dismantled in this manner. Anima is simply one of these myriad Existences, and it shall not be the last.</p>
		<h2 id='existence'>EXISTENCE</h2>
		<span class='underline2'></span>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Within all of Existence, there exists three planes of reality. The first is the Material Plane, which is the universe as we know it. The second is the Conceptual Plane, the realm of souls. The last is the Void, the land of in-betweens.</p>
		<h3 id='material-plane'>Material Plane</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Material Plane is our physical universe of matter and energy. It is a four-dimensional space composed of three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. This space contains trillions of galaxies and is billions of years old.</p>
		<h4 id='abyss'>Abyss</h4>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>Residing in the material plane is a series is interlinked micro-universes collectively referred to as the Abyss. These micro-universes are realms dominated by onturgists.</p>
		<h3 id='conceptual-plane'>Conceptual Plane</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Conceptual Plane is a sister universe to the Material Plane. It is the plane of <a class='infolink' href='metaphysics-lore'>metaphysics</a>, souls, and anima. Everything that could be categorized ontologically exists in this universe, from the idea of a cup to a quark. However, this is all conjecture as no material being has ever entered this Plane. The only information about the Conceptual Plane has come from the anecdotes of various anima and apotheons.</p>
		<h3 id='void'>Void</h3>
		<p class='infoparagraph'>The Void is a higher-dimensional space that resides in the space between the Material Plane and the Conceptual Plane. As the two planes’ meeting point, it is rich in mana. It is theoretically as expansive as our universe but is hostile to all forms of matter. Should matter enter this space unprotected, it will disappear instantaneously. However, gravity from our universe is able to penetrate space-time and enter the Void, creating areas known as "mass shadows." Due to its nature of being composed of many more spatial dimensions than the Material Plane, one location in the Void can coincide with multiple locations in the Material Plane. This property has led to the rise of a <a class='infolink' href='fasterthanlight-lore'>faster-than-light</a> method of transport known as voidjumping.</p>
